# ineptkeymac.py, version 1

# This program runs on Mac OS X, version 10.6.2 and probably several other
# versions. It uses Python 2.6, but it probably also runs on all versions
# 2.x with x >= 5.

# This program extracts the private RSA key for your ADE account in a
# standard binary form (DER format) in a file of your choosing. Its purpose
# is to make a backup of that key so that your legally bought ADE encoded
# ebooks can be salvaged in case they would no longer be supported by ADE
# software. No other usages are intended. 

# It has been tested with the key storage structure of ADE 1.7.1 and 1.7.2
# and Sony Reader Library.

# This software does not contain any encryption code. Its only use of
# external encryption software is the use of openssl for the conversion of
# the private key from pem to der format. It doesn't use encryption or
# decryption, however.

# You can run this program from the command line (python ineptkeymac.py
# filename), or by doubleclicking when it has been associated with
# Pythonlauncher. When no filename is given it will show a dialog to obtain one.
